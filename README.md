This script is used to perform a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack using Scapy, a powerful packet manipulation library. The script performs ARP spoofing to intercept traffic between a victim and a router and then sniffs the traffic for HTTP and DNS information, including potential credentials. This script can be used in public networks and can easily know the websites that the victim is using, with the help of unencrypted DNS queries made by the victim.
The scapy library is used for packet manipulation and sniffing. In scapy the http layer is used to handle HTTP packets, and the DNS layer is used to handle DNS packets
Remember to change the IP address of the victim and router according to your scenario. The script can be modified to suit different scenarios, such as changing the IP addresses of the victim and router or making the victim a wildcard user on a public network.
This Script's main objective is to easily snoop on the HTTP Traffic and Unencrypted DNS Queries.
